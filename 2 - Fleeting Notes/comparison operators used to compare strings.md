**In JavaScript, the comparison operators above can also be used to compare strings. In that case, a dictionary (lexicographical) order is applied. You can find a list of the exact order of all the characters here.**

```js
'Apple' > 'Pear'; //porÃ³wnuje litery po kolei
// => false

'a' < 'above';
// => true

'a' === 'A';
// => false

```
